# realtime-speech-to-text
This project is a real-time voice-to-text caption generator built using Hugging Face WhisperSmall model and Python. It listens through the microphone, processes the audio, and instantly converts speech into text captions. The model runs fully offline after installation, making it fast, lightweight, and privacy-friendly.
